Please note that the bot is under development and is still very far from ideal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.0 or later
- Composer (PHP dependency manager)
- A Telegram bot token obtained from @BotFather
- (Optional) A Google PageSpeed API key

### Installation

1. Create a new bot on Telegram using @BotFather and obtain your unique bot token.
2. Clone the PackBot repository to your server.
3. Navigate to the repository's root directory and run `composer install` to install required dependencies.
4. Copy the `config.example.php` file and rename it to `config.php`. Update the file with your bot token and (optionally) the Google PageSpeed API key.
5. Create a new MySQL databese and import the `structure.sql`.
6. Open your `config.php` file and update the database connection settings with your database credentials.
7. Set up the webhook by opening the `set.php` file and modifying the webhook URL to match your bot's address (e.g., `https://example.com/bot/hook.php`).

PackBot is now ready to use! Send the `/start` command to your bot on Telegram to begin.

To enable website monitoring, configure your server to execute the `cronjob.php` file every few minutes, passing the "key" parameter from `config.php` as a GET request. Additionally, schedule the `cronjob_daily.php` file to run once daily for the bot to perform routine system tasks.

## Testing

PackBot uses [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) for testing.
Functional tests require connection to the test database, so it's necessary to create and configure it in the `tests/config.test.php` file.
Enter to start tests:
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
